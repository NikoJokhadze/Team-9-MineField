# Team-9-MineField
CS 151 (Object Oriented Design) Team 9's project of the assignment "MineField Customization of the MVC Framework"

Project Description: Implementing our own version of a customizable MVC framework, and using that MVC to make a functional MineField game. The objective of the MineField game is to be able to go from the upper-left corner of a grid to the bottom-right corner, moving one square at a time in any of the 8 directions around you. Each square you step on tells you a number that indicates how many of the squares around you are rigged with a mine. The goal is to make it to the end without stepping on any mines.
